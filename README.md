# FormSuite .NET Samples

These samples are intended to demonstrate how the various functions of FormSuite family of .NET controls used to perform forms processing tasks. These samples are designed to be lightweight, concise, and show how SmartZone can be integrated into any application to perform these imaging tasks.

## Take control of your forms with our forms processing SDK

Accusoft’s structured forms processing SDK, FormSuite, combines four powerful products into one offering, ScanFix, SmartZone, FormFix, and FormAssist.  This collection allows you to enhance your application with powerful character recognition (OCR, ICR, and OMR), form identification, form dropout, scanned document cleanup, and more to eliminate slow, costly manual data entry and data extraction. Our SDK has a full-featured trial available with all of the tools and demo code at your disposal.

### Document Data Capture

Capture fields such as: typed phone numbers, signatures, filled in bubbles, hand printed text fields and more.

### Form Recognition

Build template sets for each of your forms, no need to sort forms prior to processing. FormSuite automatically identifies each form and matches to the predefined templates.

### Image Cleanup

Enhance and clean up scanned images for improved OCR/ICR/OMR performance.

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Industry-leading OCR functionality to accelerate forms processing and eliminate manual processes.

### Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR)

Utilizing the ICR technology in FormSuite your application can detect and capture handwritten information from your forms.

### Optical Mark Recognition (OMR)

Gain the functionality to detect signatures and capture data from bubble fields and checkboxes.

## Samples
